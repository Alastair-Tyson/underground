# underground

App to find the shortest path through the London Underground. 

Built using networkx and deployed on dash, this app allows you to enter two stations and find the shortest path in terms of stations plus a map showing the route. Nodes are coloured according to what platform you would need to get on. Note, the given journey may not be the quickest one, just the least number of stations.
